A car insurance premium calculated on the 'pay as you go basis' by utilizing global positioning system (GPS) and wireless technology to collect the data with regards to the utilization of the policyholder's cars. Financial break-even analysis was conducted for the state of Texas. Based on the analysis if the customer base within Texas increased by 30% from the existing base (assumptions listed in the analysis) over the course of the next five years then the initial investment of the Autograph technology would prove to generate profit margins."/>
