The earnings before interest and taxes depreciation and amortization was highest for hotel lodging, which was approximately more than 40% of the total EBITDA.  The high revenue stream from hotel lodging and non-gaming entertainment led senior management of MGM Grand hotel to contemplate whether it was possible to analyze and collect the customer profitability from just the non-gaming entertainment business. The business could then be segmented in terms of non-gaming customers. Once that data was analyzed, it could be utilized to make future decisions towards increasing revenue and profit streams."/>

The existing infrastructure that MGM Grand hotel had to collect customer profitability in the gaming section could be leveraged to help distinguish profitability between the non gaming and gaming revenue. In terms of gaming revenue it was able to correlate up to 75% of the revenue to specific customer segments based on their expected gambling amount per trip or theoretical win. Assuming a gambler used the available Players club card the hotel could trace around 65% of all slot revenues to specific customers.  From the data provided by the players club, floor personal and the data collection infrastructure the MGM Information technology group was able to calculate customer profitability by taking into account the customer gaming revenue stream (theoretical win) against costs such as operations, marketing, personnel, equipment maintenance and real estate.

However the data is incomplete, the expenditures from the customer's side for non-gaming profits are visible in the hotel's database only if the customer decides to charge against the lodging room. Due to this limitation it is estimated that only 60% of the food/beverage and entertainment that a customer spends on non-gaming activities is included in MGM Grand's non gaming revenue calculations. The methodology to calculate the non gaming expenses, revenue and hence profits had severe limitations which prevented the senior management from having visibility into non gaming customer profitability."/>

The non gaming transactions could also have similar rewards or points systems. Another idea could be that on check-in into the MGM Grand Hotel, the customers would have the option to have a different non gaming 'activity club card'. To provide an incentive to the customers to utilize this card towards nongaming transactions could be to offer discounts if the card was used towards entertainment, foods &amp; beverages. The card could also carry a reward systems based on points collection.  Similar concept could be that MGM Grand provides its own credit card based on credit history to customers to utilize on food &amp; beverages and entertainment and hence track the expenses.  A different concept would be for the customer themselves to provide the information on their costs and spending during their trip.  Most families travel on a budget and keep track of their costs, so they could provide this information to MGM Grand and in return receive certain comps.  The technology is available and can be applied to MGM Grand technology infrastructure to collect data in terms just expenses and profits for customers from non – gaming activities."/>
